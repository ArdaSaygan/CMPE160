	 * Assult is an important method in the project. It's called in Main.Assult() method. 
	 * <P>
	 * When assault takes place all Republic Cruisers will choose the closest Separatist Warship as their target 
	 * such that the target will be on their right side (Target should have a greater x-coordinate) 
	 * and that target should have a strictly smaller power output than the cruiser. 
	 * When two republic cruiser aims for the same target, only the one who is closer to the target will attack 
	 * and the other one wonâ€™t attack or search for a new target.
	 * <P>
	 * My Approach: I first put every warship in the sector that is not destroyed to a 	LinkedList called warshipsLinked.
	 * While adding them to the LinkedList I insert them so that LinkedList will always be in order. 
	 * <P>
	 * Then I iterated over this warshipLinked from the 0th index. WarshipsLinked was ordered in descending order of coordinates.
	 * This is what I do:<P>
	 * 		1) Find the Republic Cruiser with the biggest coordinate<P>
	 * 		2) Then look at the ships with greater coordinate than this ship, find the closest Separatist Ship with less PowerOutput<P>
	 * 		3) If this Separatist Ship is in Attacked list, continue with the nextrepublic Cruiser. Otherwise attack the ship and put  it in the Attacked list<P>
	 * For every Republic Cruiser we search the ships in front of it. So if there are a total of N republic Cruisers and no Seperators,
	 * the worst case scenario will be O(n*(n+1)/2) = O(N^2)
	 * <P>
