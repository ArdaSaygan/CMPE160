This project was designed to make students capable of handling big projects with the basic principles of OOP, prepared by the hardwork of Halil Kasapoğlu and Yiğit Yıldırım.
This repo contains the codes I have written as solutions to the project task. Some descriptive files about the project problem is also included, which are prepared by Halil Kasapoğlu.

## Overview Of the Project 
The main task is to implement multiple classes to simulate the Star Wars universe and some events. For grading, students are given some events as inputs and they should carry out these events in the simulation. Then the program should give an output of the eventual situation after the events.

A pdf file explainig the architecture of classes, their attributes and methods was provided. Description file of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/ArdaSaygan/CMPE160/files/9743957/p2_description.pdf)

The class hierarchy of the program can be seen in the diagram below, which is taken from the description file.

Every class have attributes and methods to increase the functionality of the simulation. Operations that can be performed are listed below.
