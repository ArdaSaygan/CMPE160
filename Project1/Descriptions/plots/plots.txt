These plots should give you a rough idea of airport point generation.


Green regions are around hub airport points and each green circle has a radius of 7000 units.

Blue regions are around major airport points and each blue circle has a radius of 5000 units.

Red regions are around regional airport points and each red circle has a radius of 1500 units.

These circles are there to give you an idea of airport connectivity and aircraft ranges.

linear scatter has the same hub generation as normal scatter it's just a little more linear.
